\description{
Functions used for moving and creating the \code{past_results_v2} data set from
uploaded data. The \code{move_files} function is used to moved files from the server
to another location, whilst removing any empty data sets.
}
\note{
One of the unit tests uploads an empty results file.
Files where the results are \code{NULL} are moved to a sub-directory (called)
\code{empty} in the \code{to} directory. If the \code{empty} directory doesn't
exist, it is created.

Currently these functions are specific to my set-up.
